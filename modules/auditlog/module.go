// Package auditlog is the audit-log area: the read surface over the records
// the application writes about itself.
//
// It is an area of its own rather than a feature of identity because it
// belongs to no feature: sign-in, sign-up, account administration, and
// verification all write records, and the area that reads them is the one
// place that answers "what happened" across all of them. The writer is not
// here — internal/audit owns it, so a feature can record without importing
// this area and a module can be swapped without touching what it describes.
//
// The area owns its own wiring, like every other: the registry names it and
// knows nothing about its service.
