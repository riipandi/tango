//
// The nullable ones are read through a cast rather than a pointer: an absent
// account is the empty string a client sees, and the cast is where that is
// decided. `payload` is read as text and decoded by the caller, so the
// decoder is the one this repository names rather than the driver's.
// Every column is qualified with the record table's alias: the list joins the
// account table, and a bare `id` or `created_at` would be ambiguous the moment
// it does.
