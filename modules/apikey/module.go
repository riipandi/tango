// Package apikey is the API key area: the machine credentials an account
// issues for its own scripting and integrations.
//
// It is an area of its own rather than a feature of identity because the
// credential is not an account fact — it is a credential a transport
// authenticates with, the way a session is, and the surface that manages it
// is the one surface such a credential is refused on.
//
// The area owns its own wiring, like every other: the registry names it and
// knows nothing about its service. The transport's authenticator is the one
// consumer outside the area the credential has, and it resolves through the
// container like any other consumer — the registration lives here, with the
// service.
