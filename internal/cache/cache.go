// configuration and hands back whichever driver applies — or Noop, which
// answers every read with a miss, so a feature never checks whether caching
// is on and a call site stays identical in every deployment.

// remote driver owns a network round trip, and a request that was cancelled
// must not pay for one.

// Values are bytes, and keys are strings: a cache entry is a serialized
// payload, so the driver never inspects what it holds. Get writes into dst —
// the append-style of an API designed to be used in zero-allocation mode, so
// a hot call site reuses its buffer and a hit costs no allocation at all.

	// nothing.
