// remote driver owns a network round trip, and a request that was cancelled
// must not pay for one.

// Values are bytes, and keys are strings: a cache entry is a serialized
// payload, so the driver never inspects what it holds. Get writes into dst —
// the append-style of an API designed to be used in zero-allocation mode, so
// a hot call site reuses its buffer and a hit costs no allocation at all.

// "no", in a run that keeps working.

//     but its backend is not available, so the same run skips it;
//   - an unknown driver — the configuration refuses it elsewhere, and a run
//     that carried one anyway degrades to no cache.
//
// kv is the shared backend client the kvstore driver reads through, built
// by the composition root when the backend is enabled; the factory never
// opens one. Noop is the reason a feature never branches on the caching
// question: the answer to "cached?" is simply "no" in every bypassed case.
