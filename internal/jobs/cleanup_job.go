// Package jobs holds the concrete jobs the application runs on the queue.
//
// A job file — one job per *_job.go — declares the task type it enqueues, the
// queue configuration that governs it, and the processor that executes it.
// register.go lists every job the application runs, so the composition root
// has one call to make and a job has one place to be spelled out. The engine
// itself (internal/queue) knows none of them: jobs are application code, the
// queue is infrastructure.
//
// A recurring job keeps its own schedule: its processor enqueues the next
// instance before returning, and Register seeds the first one only while no
// task of that queue is pending, so a restart never adds a second schedule.
