//
// It exists because a route table is the wrong place to answer "who may call
// this": the answer depends on the caller's claims, and a table that mixed
// routing with claims would be read by two audiences with nothing in common.
// The transport owns the mechanism — a refusal is written in the protocol the
// caller used — and this package owns the policy: which rule, and what a rule
// compares.

// The tables are the surface's contract with itself. A procedure or route
// absent from them is administrative, which is the safe default: forgetting
// to declare something refuses it rather than publishing it.
