// Package static serves the files a feature wrote under the data directory's
// uploads subdirectory, at the route prefix app.assets_url points at.
//
// It lives under transport because it is part of the HTTP surface, beside
// middleware: it is a mount the router composes, not a service a module owns,
// and nothing outside transport imports it. It is separate from
// web.SetupStatic, which serves the compiled SPA: the two answer different
// questions, and keeping them apart is what lets this one have no fallback —
// a missing upload is a 404, never an HTML page.
//
// What a key is served from is a driver behind Upload, so the mount outlives
// the local filesystem. A driver over an object store answers the same call by
// handing the client a URL, and the route, the key, and the not-found boundary
// stay as they are.
