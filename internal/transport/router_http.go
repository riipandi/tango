// the request timeout.

// subrouter, because a module mounts its own routes — a feature under /api, a
// protocol endpoint at /.well-known — on the router it is handed, and
// middleware attached to the /api subrouter never reaches them. The group is
// what makes the limiter cover every mounted route without also covering the
// SPA. Paths that must never be throttled are listed in rateLimitExclusions.
//
// The SPA is mounted last: its handler answers whatever the routes above it
// did not claim, and its own not-found rule keeps API and protocol paths from
// being answered with index.html.
