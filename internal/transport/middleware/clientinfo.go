// FingerprintHeader is the header the frontend sends its browser fingerprint
// in.
//
// It is a header rather than a field in every request message because the
// fingerprint is a property of the client, not of the call: a frontend sets
// it once in its fetch interceptor and every procedure carries it, without a
// contract change per request and without a client that forgets it being
// unable to call anything. A request without the header records no
// fingerprint, which is the state every non-browser caller is in.
//
// The value is stored as it arrived. It is opaque here: the frontend computes
// it, and a server that tried to interpret it would be asserting something it
// cannot know.
const FingerprintHeader = "X-Device-Fingerprint"

// ClientInfo captures where a request came from, so a seam below can write it
// into a record without knowing it is inside a request at all.
//
// It is mounted once, on the router that holds every route and every
// procedure, rather than per surface: the facts come from the HTTP request in
// both cases, and a second mount is a second place to forget. The context it
// fills is read through audit.ClientFromContext, which is what keeps a
// service from taking four parameters it only passes on.
//
// The address is resolved by chi's own middlewares and read back through
// chimiddleware.GetClientIP, so the record and the rate limiter agree about
// who the client is. A header a caller can set is not believed: only headers
// the deployment declares its proxy overwrites are read at all.

// clientIPResolver answers the middleware that decides the client's address.
//
// With no trusted header configured, the connection's own address is the
// answer: the process is reached directly, and X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-IP is
// a header the caller writes. With headers configured, the deployment has said
// its proxy sets them on every request, and the first one that carries a
// parseable address is the hop closest to the client.
//
// The list is ordered, and the order is the precedence: the first header is
// the most preferred, and a header later in the list is read only when every
// header before it was absent. A deployment that terminates TLS itself and
// sits behind a CDN names both — its own proxy's header first, the CDN's
// second — so the address closest to the process wins when both are present.
//
// Every listed header must be one the proxy overwrites on every request.
// Naming a header a proxy merely forwards is what lets a caller choose the
// address a rate-limit bucket and an audit record are keyed by: a header that
// reaches the process unmodified is a header the client wrote.
//
// The connection's address is the last resort, so a request that carries no
// listed header still records where it came from — a health probe on the
// loopback, a test, a client that bypassed the proxy. It never replaces an
// address a listed header supplied: the connection is the proxy's address in
// that case, which is the less useful of the two.

// the rate limiter reads it through GetClientIP, and an address written under
// a second key would be one the limiter never sees. The composition is what
// keeps one address per request across the two consumers.
//
// A header that resolved an address short-circuits the rest: a later header
// must not replace an earlier one, or the order in the configuration would
