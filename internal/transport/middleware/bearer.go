//
// A procedure named in public is answered without a caller; every other path
// requires one, so a new procedure is protected by default and a public one
// is a deliberate entry in the guard table. A nil authenticator returns the
// handler unchanged, which is the state a test that reads only responses is
// in.

// may run the procedure is the guard interceptor's decision, made once the

// set, a picture fetched by an <img> tag — and every other route requires
// one, so a new route is protected by default and a public one is a
// deliberate entry in internal/guard.
//
// The verified caller travels through the context the authn library reads,
// the same store the RPC surface's middleware fills, so a handler reads its
