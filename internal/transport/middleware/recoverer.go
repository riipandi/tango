// Recoverer turns a panicking handler into a 500 response.
//
// Without it a panic closes the connection and the only trace of the failure
// is net/http's own stderr line, which carries no request id and reaches no
// configured transport. The panic value and the stack are logged through the
// process logger, and the response is the standard error envelope, so a client
// that was promised JSON never receives a bare protocol error instead.
//
// http.ErrAbortHandler is re-panicked: it is the handler's way to ask for the
// connection to be dropped, and answering it with an envelope would undo that.
//
// A panic after the response began — a streaming handler, a flush mid-write —
// cannot be answered with an envelope, so only the log line is written and the
// broken response is left as it is.
