// Package observer wires the process's traces and metrics.
//
// It follows the same shape as internal/logger: the resolved configuration is
// the only source of truth, each signal is opt-in, and a signal nothing enables
// dials nothing. Logging is not here — internal/logger owns it — but the three
// signals share one collector address and one resource, so the two packages
// describe the same service from the same configuration. The exporter plumbing
// all of them need (transport credentials, TLS, compression, signal routes)
// lives here in exporter.go, and the logger's OTLP sink consumes it rather
// than carrying a copy.
//
// # Nothing on the request path blocks
//
// Every signal is exported from an in-memory queue drained by a background
// goroutine: spans go through a batch span processor, measurements through a
// periodic reader. Recording a span or a measurement enqueues and returns, so a
// collector that is slow, unreachable, or absent costs dropped telemetry and
// never a slow request. When a queue is full the oldest item is dropped and the
// SDK counts it; nothing here waits for room.
//
// # The environment is not a source
//
// The OpenTelemetry SDK reads OTEL_* variables on its own — OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*,
// OTEL_SERVICE_NAME, OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES, OTEL_SDK_DISABLED — which would
// be a second configuration source deciding what this process reports and
// where. The configuration file is the single source of truth, so every exporter
// option and every resource attribute is passed explicitly here. A stray export
// in a shell must not be able to redirect telemetry or rename the service.
