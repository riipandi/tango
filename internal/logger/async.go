// The request path emits one log line per request, and a synchronous write
// per line puts a syscall on the critical path of every response — measured
// at a fifth of the throughput a load test reaches without it. The sinks a
// request writes to are therefore wrapped in asyncTransport: an entry is
// handed to a bounded queue and one worker per sink renders and writes it.
//
// The queue never drops. A full queue blocks the caller, so under sustained
// overload the cost of logging shows up as latency, never as a lost line —
// the guarantee the synchronous sink gave, kept by the wrapper. Shutdown
// drains the queue, so a graceful stop loses nothing either; only a kill -9
// between enqueue and drain can lose what the queue still holds, the same
// window any buffering accepts.
//
// The OTLP sink is deliberately not wrapped: its batch processor already
// queues in the background, and a second queue would only defer the same
// drops behind another buffer.
