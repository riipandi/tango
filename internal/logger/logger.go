// Package logger wires the process's logging stack.
//
// One LogLayer core sits behind a *slog.Logger, so application code — and every
// dependency that logs through log/slog — emits into the same pipeline. The
// sinks are the ones the configuration names in log.transport: the console, a
// rotating file, and an OpenTelemetry exporter, in any combination. Feature code
// never touches LogLayer directly; it calls slog, and this package decides where
// the entry goes.
//
// # One frontend
//
// slog is the frontend, and the LogLayer core is an implementation detail of it.
// slog is a standard interface, so a dependency that accepts a *slog.Logger can
// be handed this one and lands in the same pipeline; a handler written against
// slog keeps working. LogLayer's own API is the same information said twice, and
// exposing it would leave a codebase with two logging idioms where the second
// one skips the handler everything else is wired through.
