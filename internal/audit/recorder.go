//
// A record is written through the caller's query surface, which is what makes

// It fills in the two things that come from the request rather than from the
// action, so a caller supplies only what happened:
//
//   - the client facts, when the entry carries none. They are what the
//     transport captured for this request (audit.ClientFromContext), which is
//     why a service never threads an address, an agent, or a fingerprint
//     through its own signature.
//   - the actor, when the caller is impersonating. The delegation is read
//     from the token rather than passed in, so every record written while one
//     account acts as another names the administrator behind it without the
//     feature that writes it knowing delegation exists.
//
// It never fails the caller. A record is a description of an action that has
// already happened, so refusing the action because its description could not
// be written would trade the thing the caller asked for against the thing
// that documents it. The failure is logged instead, with the event, so a
// broken audit trail is visible without being fatal.
//
// The signature takes the query surface rather than reaching for the pool,
// which is the whole reason a record can join the caller's transaction.
