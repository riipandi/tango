// Package audit is the vocabulary an audit record is written in, and the
// recorder that writes it.
//
// It is infrastructure rather than a module: a record is written from the
// request that caused it, in the same transaction, so every feature that
// changes something reaches the recorder the way it reaches the pool — by
// invoking it from the container. The module that *reads* records is
// modules/auditlog; this package never serves a request.
//
// The split is the same one internal/queue keeps: the vocabulary and the
// writer are shared, the surface that exposes them belongs to a module.

// The event names a record carries. They are this application's own spelling,
// snake_case like every other field it writes, rather than upstream's
// SCREAMING_SNAKE: a client reads `sign_in` beside `status_code`, and the two
// vocabularies would be one more thing to translate.
//
// An event names what happened, not which procedure answered. `user_created`
// is written by both the administrator's CreateUser and the sign-up flow,
// because a reader asking "when was this account created" wants one answer.
//
// TODO(audit): sign-out has no event here because it has no procedure — the
// session feature is a scaffold, and an event for a path nothing can take
// would be a name no writer reaches.
