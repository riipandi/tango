// Area is one area the application serves, together with the services it owns.
//
// It is the whole seam between this package and a module: the composition root
// knows an area provides services and produces a module, and knows nothing
// about which services those are or what the area does with them. The wiring
// inside an area — which service its features are built from, which of them
// must be validated before the listener opens — lives in the area, not here.
//
// A consumer outside this repository embeds its own area by passing one to
// New. It needs no edit to this package, which is what makes the module half
// composable rather than merely separate.

	// container is built, so it must only register: a service is constructed
	// when something resolves it.

	// router mounts. An error here fails the run before the listener opens.
