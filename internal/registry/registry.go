// Package registry is the composition root: the one place the shared
// dependencies are registered with samber/do and wired onto each other.
//
// The package is split along one boundary:
//
//   - infrastructure.go registers what the process runs on — the pool, the
//     cache, the queue, the storage engine, the outbound client. It names no
//     module, and importing one there would be visible in a one-line diff.
//   - modules.go registers what the application mounts. An area owns its own
//     wiring and reaches infrastructure only by invoking it from the
//     container, so this file never names an area's internals — it holds the
//     list, and a consumer can append to it.
//   - this file joins the two. The router and the server are the only things
//     that need both, so they are the only ones that name both.
//
// Each half is a `do.Package`, so `do.New` reads as the composition list
// itself: the values the command owns, the infrastructure, the modules.
//
// Services are lazy: the pool and the health checker are built when the first
// service that needs them is invoked, which is the moment serve resolves the
// server. A dependency that cannot be built — a database that is down, a data
// directory that cannot be used — fails that invocation, before the listener
// opens.
