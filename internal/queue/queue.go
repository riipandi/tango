// Package queue is tango's embedded task queue: type-safe queues over the
// shared Postgres pool, executed by an in-process worker pool. It is a port
// of mikestefanello/backlite (MIT) adapted to this architecture — the schema
// comes from the migrations, the queries from go-sqlbuilder, and the logs
// from log/slog — and the engine is owned here, so upstream is not tracked.
//
// A task is a payload type declaring the queue it belongs to; a queue is that
// declaration plus the callback that executes it. Tasks are inserted into
// public.queue_tasks and survive a restart; the dispatcher claims, runs, and
// archives them through public.queue_tasks_completed. The concrete jobs of
// the application live in internal/jobs.
