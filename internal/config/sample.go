// secretKeys are the keys a generated file must not carry a literal value for.
// A secret is a property of the key, not of its default: app.base_url has an
// empty default too, and it is not a secret.
//
// otel.headers is the one key here whose value is a map rather than a string,
// and it is a secret as a whole: an authorization token is the reason the key
// exists, and the names inside are chosen by the user, so there is no per-entry
// key to list. Every value is rendered through the same path (see
// redactHeaders), and a generated file asks for the one variable that carries
// them all.
//
// A test asserts this list is exactly the set of keys Redacted replaces, so the
// two cannot drift: adding a secret to one without the other fails.

// nullKeys are the keys a generated file writes as null rather than as an empty
// string, because empty has no meaning for them: an empty prefix is "no prefix",
// which the key being absent says more directly.
//
// The two forms resolve alike — a null in the file leaves the key at its default
// — so this is about what the file reads like, not about what it does.

	"storage.s3.path_prefix",
}

// envKeys are the keys a generated file writes as an env: directive even though
// the value is not a secret, mapped to the variable each one names.
//
// A deployment sets the runtime mode, the public base URL, the origin the
// browser fetches assets from, and the collector it ships telemetry to, so a
// generated file asks for the variable rather than baking in a value that
// would be wrong there. The variable name is written out instead of derived
// from the key, because the two do not always agree: app.base_url is
// PUBLIC_BASE_URL, the name the origin is known by outside this file, not
// APP_BASE_URL, and app.assets_url is PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL for the same reason —
// the same origin an S3 bucket or a CDN is published at.
//
// A path is deliberately not here. storage.local_path comes from the file alone:
// where an instance writes its files is a property of the deployment image, and a
// variable would let a run disagree with the configuration about it. The file
// sink has no path key at all for the same reason; it writes under that
// directory.
//
// The collector is the other way round, and reads like the kvstore section: a
// deployment is the one that knows whether it has a collector and where it
// listens, so its address is a directive. The endpoint is shared by the three
// signals, so one variable moves all of them together, and each signal keeps its
// own enable switch in the file.
//
// The transport list is a directive for a third reason: it is the one logging
// key a deployment changes per environment, keeping the terminal locally and
// shipping to a collector in production, and a comma-separated value is exactly
// what an environment variable can carry (see listKeys).
//
// A key may also appear in secretKeys, which runs first: secretKeys says the
// value is a secret, and this map says what the variable is called. kvstore.url
// is the case where the two disagree, being VALKEY_URL rather than KVSTORE_URL.
//
// Validate reports a key here only when the variable leaves it unusable. An unset
// APP_MODE falls back to development, an empty base_url is a valid value, an unset
// APP_ASSETS_URL falls back to the built-in /static mount, an unset OTEL_ENDPOINT
// falls back to the collector on the default port, and an unset HOST or PORT falls
// back to the listen address in the defaults, so none of
// them is an error on its own: naming them would report a choice the user made on
// purpose.
