// it to mapstructure as a float64, mapstructure sets the nanoseconds of a
// time.Duration straight from it, and 900 becomes 900ns. Naming the keys is what
// makes seconds the unit. The alternative, inferring the unit from the Go type,
// cannot work: a duration is an int64, so is an ordinary number, and a hook
// would have to guess at every integer in the configuration.
//
// A test asserts this list is exactly the set of time.Duration fields on Config,
// so adding a duration field fails until it is listed here.
