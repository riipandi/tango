// one string by the time the file layer has resolved it, and a list written as
// one comma-separated string is the only form an environment variable can carry:
// `LOG_TRANSPORT=console,file`. Without this step koanf decodes that string into
// a one-element list holding "console,file", which names no sink.

// its siblings. A map is one value holding several entries whose names the user
// chooses: walking otel.headers would produce otel.headers.authorization, a key
// that is not part of Config, and filterKnown would drop it — leaving the header
// silently unset rather than reported.

// rename cannot leave a key behind that nothing reads.
