# Endpoint Reference (Pocket ID upstream)

Source: <https://pocket-id.org/swagger.yaml> — grouped by spec tag. Use as the Yaak
request checklist: one request per row, named `<METHOD> <path>` for REST and
`<METHOD> /rpc/<package>.<Service>/<Method>` for ConnectRPC. Status vocabulary:
**done** (implemented with test evidence in the Evidence column), **partial**
(implemented with a noted deviation), **planned** (unimplemented — owning phase
named), **excluded** (out of scope per `.llms/tango-deviations.md` — never parity work).

Tango-only extensions (not in the upstream spec) and all structural deviations (envelope,
pagination, snake_case) are documented in `.llms/tango-deviations.md` — read it before porting
upstream handlers.

## Transport split

First-party application surfaces are ConnectRPC below `/rpc`: the SPA, the admin console, and
internal tools call the generated clients from `api/connect/*.proto`. The `Endpoint` column keeps
the original REST path for traceability; it is no longer mounted. Protocol and infrastructure
surfaces stay HTTP below `/api` (or their root path) and are marked `REST`.

Protected RPCs authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <internal-access-token>`; the admin
application API also accepts `X-API-KEY` for machine clients. Self-service and credential-lifecycle
procedures — the account surface, `UserService` self procedures, email verification, one-time
access administration, signup-token administration, MFA, and device approval — never accept a
machine credential, so a leaked key cannot rotate its owner's password or edit its owner's profile.
Cookie presence never authorizes an RPC.

Every procedure is called with `POST`; `GET` is reserved for procedures that declare
`idempotency_level = NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`, and no procedure in `api/connect/` does, so a `GET` on any
procedure answers `405` with `Allow: POST` (`internal/transport.TestRPCRejectsGet`).

The contracts frozen so far are `tango.common.v1` (`common.proto`: the shared response metadata
block) and `tango.system.v1` (`system.proto`: `HealthService`). The transport rules — snake_case
field naming on both surfaces, and an unknown `/rpc` path answering the Connect error document —
are pinned by `internal/transport/handler_rpc_test.go`.

## Authentication (tango-only)

Password authentication is a tango-only surface: upstream Pocket ID signs users in with passkeys
only. Contracts below define the full password lifecycle.

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AuthService/SignIn` | Sign in with password | done — body `{identity, password, remember}`; indistinguishable failures for unknown identity vs wrong password; disabled accounts fail closed; `remember` selects the long or short session lifetime; sets the token cookies | `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignInIssuesCookies`, `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignInPendingFlow`, `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignInRememberSelectsLifetime` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AuthService/SignOut` | Sign out | done — revokes the token family and clears cookies; the REST twin below is the worker's cookie-channel fallback | `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignOutAndSession` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AuthService/GetSession` | Inspect current session | done | `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignOutAndSession` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AuthService/ForgotPassword` | Request a password reset (RPC, unimplemented) | done — declared for contract completeness; answers `unimplemented`; recovery is served by the retained REST routes | `modules/identity/recovery.TestForgotIsAlwaysGeneric` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AuthService/ResetPassword` | Reset a password (RPC, unimplemented) | done — declared for contract completeness; answers `unimplemented`; recovery is served by the retained REST routes | `modules/identity/recovery.TestResetLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AccountService/ChangePassword` | Change own password | done — current secret required; other sessions revoked; refuses a machine credential | `modules/identity/account.TestAccountRPCSelfService` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AccountService/ListSessions` | List own sessions | done — self-service; refuses a machine credential | `modules/identity/account.TestAccountRPCSelfService` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.AccountService/RevokeSession` | Revoke one own session | done — self-service; refuses a machine credential | `modules/identity/account.TestAccountRPCSelfService` |
| POST | `/api/auth/token` | Cookie bridge for the auth worker | REST — access/refresh cookies in, access token + rotation out; never bearer | `modules/identity/session.TestTokenBridgeBootstrapAndRotation`, `modules/identity/session.TestTokenBridgeRejectsAnonymous` |
| POST | `/api/auth/sign-out` | Sign out (cookie channel) | REST — worker fallback when the bearer path is unusable | `modules/identity/session.TestRPCSignOutAndSession` |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Request a password reset | REST — anonymous; always 204; queues recovery email; the RPC twin answers `unimplemented` | `modules/identity/recovery.TestForgotIsAlwaysGeneric` |
| POST | `/api/auth/reset-password` | Reset with a reset token | REST — hashed single-use token; revokes sessions; rotates cookies; the RPC twin answers `unimplemented` | `modules/identity/recovery.TestResetLifecycle` |

Shared rules: the sign-in procedure and both recovery endpoints ride the tight auth rate budget;
recovery responses never reveal whether the address exists; reset tokens are SHA-256 hashed with
purpose-prefixed keys and expire in 15 minutes; a completed reset revokes every sign-in session of
the account and issues a fresh session for the requester; audit events cover sign-in, sign-out,
password changes, and reset requests/completions without logging secrets.

## One-Time Access

The codes that sign an account in without its password, ported from upstream Pocket ID's
one-time access feature. An administrator issues a code for one account or sends it by email;
an account holder asks for the email from the sign-in page. The exchange is the procedure the
frontend reaches with the code the email linked to, and it answers the token pair a password
sign-in answers with, under a session whose provider names `one_time_access`.

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auth.v1.OneTimeAccessService/CreateToken` | Create one-time access token for user (admin) | done — guard `Admin`; body `{id, ttl_seconds?}` (60..86400, unset 900); the six-character form is a code that lives fifteen minutes or less, twelve above; answers `{token, expires_at}`; only the hash is stored, so the response is the last the code exists | `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestCreateTokenIssuesACodeTheExchangeAccepts`, `internal/transport.TestTheOneTimeAccessLoopEndsInASession` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auth.v1.OneTimeAccessService/ExchangeToken` | Exchange one-time access token | done — guard `Public`, the one procedure a caller reaches without a credential; body `{token, device_token?}`; the code's spend, the session it opens, and the audit record commit in one transaction, so a rollback returns the code; a device token the email request paired with the code must come back exact, and a mismatch leaves the code spendable; a disabled or banned account is refused with the code intact; answers the token pair + user view | `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestExchangeRefusesADeviceTokenThatDoesNotMatch`, `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestExchangeRefusesADisabledOrBannedAccount`, `internal/transport.TestTheOneTimeAccessGuardIsDeclared` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auth.v1.OneTimeAccessService/RequestEmailAsAdmin` | Request one-time access email (admin) | done — guard `Admin`; body `{id, ttl_seconds?}`; refused with `permission_denied` while `auth.one_time_access_email_as_admin_enabled` is off (default); the code travels by email alone, never through the caller; the message rides the `one_time_access_email` queue task (3 attempts, 30s timeout, 15s backoff — tighter than the verification email's, because the code expires) | `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestRequestEmailAsAdminSendsWithoutExposingTheCode`, `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestRequestEmailRefusesADisabledPath` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auth.v1.OneTimeAccessService/RequestEmail` | Request one-time access email | done — guard `Public`; body `{email, redirect_path?}`; refused with `permission_denied` while `auth.one_time_access_email_as_unauthenticated_enabled` is off (default); an address no account holds answers the same success a known one does, so the response is not the enumeration; the answer carries a 16-character device token the exchange demands back, real whether the address exists or not | `modules/identity/onetimeaccess.TestRequestEmailAnswersTheSameForAnUnknownAddress`, `internal/transport.TestTheOneTimeAccessGuardIsDeclared` |

Shared rules: codes are drawn from an alphabet without ambiguous characters and stored as
SHA-256 hashes; the unique index on `(user_id, purpose)` keeps an account to one code at a time,
so a re-request is a re-issue and the table never grows past the account count; an expired code
is refused and its row stays until the account's next code replaces it — the refusal runs inside
the transaction a sweep would have to survive, and the sweep is exactly what a rollback undoes.
The email links to `<base-url>/login-code?code=<token>` (plus `&redirect=` when the ask carried
a path), and the frontend forwards the code to the exchange. Audit events: `one_time_access_email_sent`
(the address only — the code is never in the record) and `one_time_access_sign_in`.

## MFA TOTP (tango-only)

Upstream Pocket ID has no TOTP; this surface is tango-only and follows the database contract in
`.llms/porting-plan/database.md` (`user_mfa_totp`, `user_mfa_recovery_codes`,
`user_mfa_pending`).

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/EnrollTotp` | Start TOTP enrollment | done — self; returns the raw secret + otpauth URI exactly once; re-enroll replaces an unconfirmed row | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/ConfirmTotp` | Confirm and enable TOTP | done — verifies one code; sets `confirmed_at`; returns recovery codes exactly once | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/GetTotpStatus` | TOTP status | done — confirmed flag + remaining recovery-code count | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/VerifyPending` | Complete a pending sign-in | done — pending-auth cookie; accepts a TOTP code or a recovery code; issues the full session | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCVerifyPending` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/RotateRecoveryCodes` | Rotate recovery codes | done — requires a valid TOTP code; returns the new codes exactly once | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCLifecycle` |
| POST| `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.MfaService/DisableTotp` | Disable TOTP | done — requires the current password; drops all MFA state | `modules/identity/totp.TestMfaRPCLifecycle` |

Fixed parameters: issuer = the configured app name, 6 digits, 30-second period, SHA-1,
±1 step bounded skew. Sign-in composition: a confirmed TOTP enrollment turns a successful
password sign-in into a pending authentication (5-minute TTL, one row per user, cookie-bound)
instead of a full session; the full session is issued only by `VerifyPending`. Pending state is
never a session flag, expires server-side, is replaced on the next sign-in, and is cleared on
sign-out. TOTP verification is constant-time with step replay protection (`last_used_step`);
recovery codes are hashed, single-use, shown exactly once, and rotated atomically. Disablement
requires the current password and clears every MFA row.

## Webhooks (tango-only)

Upstream Pocket ID has no webhooks; this surface is tango-only and follows the database contract
in `.llms/porting-plan/database.md` (`webhook_endpoints`, `webhook_deliveries`,
`webhook_delivery_attempts`).

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/List` | List webhook endpoints | done — admin guard; `enabled` and `event` filters; secrets never present | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/Create` | Create a webhook endpoint | done — returns the signing secret exactly once | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/Get` | Get a webhook endpoint | done — no secret field | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/Update` | Update a webhook endpoint | done — partial update; absent fields keep values | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/Delete` | Delete a webhook endpoint | done — deliveries survive with `webhook_id` nulled | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/RotateSecret` | Rotate the signing secret | done — returns the new plaintext exactly once; new deliveries sign with it | `modules/webhook.TestRPCRotateSecret` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/Test` | Send a test delivery | done — queues a `webhook.test` delivery | `modules/webhook.TestRPCTestDelivery` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/ListDeliveries` | List deliveries of one endpoint | done — newest first, paginated; latest attempt rides along | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.webhook.v1.WebhookService/ListAllDeliveries` | List all deliveries | done — `event` filter; redacted response metadata only | `modules/webhook.TestRPCWebhookLifecycle` |

Delivery contract: HMAC-SHA256 over `t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` where the digest covers the signed
timestamp concatenated with the exact canonical body bytes. Headers on every delivery:
`X-Signature` (timestamp + `v1` digest, ±5-minute verification skew), `X-Webhook-Event` (event
name), `X-Webhook-Id` (endpoint id), `Content-Type: application/json`. The canonical body is the
deterministic JSON encoding of the payload, capped at 1 MiB, stored once as immutable bytes and
reused byte-for-byte by every retry — the signature therefore stays valid across retries. Custom
registration headers cannot override the signature set. Subscriptions use event names or the
`*` wildcard; an empty list receives every event. Retries run on the queue (5 attempts, 30 s
backoff, 30 s receiver deadline); non-2xx and transport failures are recorded per attempt and
pruned after a week. Rotation affects new deliveries only and never returns the stored
ciphertext.

## API Keys

The machine credentials an account issues for its own scripting and integrations. A key acts as
its owner through the same guard table a session does — an administrator's key administers — but
the surface that manages the keys refuses it, the way the upstream it ports disables API-key
authentication on its own routes: a credential that cannot revoke itself must not be the one
managing credentials.

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.apikey.v1.ApiKeyService/CreateAPIKey` | Create API key | done — guard `Session`, the rule a machine credential is refused by; the raw key is `<prefix>.<secret>`, drawn from the full alphanumeric alphabet with the crypto source, and shown exactly once — the row stores the SHA-256 of the presented string, so a database leak cannot replay it; the name is unique per owner (the `(name, owner)` index), the window must lie in the future, and a duplicate answers `already_exists` | `modules/apikey.TestCreateShowsTheKeyOnceAndRefusesADuplicateName` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.apikey.v1.ApiKeyService/ListAPIKeys` | List API keys | done — the caller's own keys, newest first, revoked ones included; revoked stays listed because the revocation is a stamp the view carries, not a deletion | `modules/apikey.TestListOwnScopesToTheOwnerAndListAllSeesEverything` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.apikey.v1.ApiKeyService/RenewAPIKey` | Renew API key | done — guard `Session`; an unexpired key is refused with `failed_precondition` (renewal is how a key lives past its expiry, not how it escapes one); an expired one earns a new secret and a new window, the reminder stamp dies with the old window, and the new raw key is shown once | `modules/apikey.TestRenewReplacesAnExpiredKeyAndRefusesALiveOne` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.apikey.v1.ApiKeyService/RevokeAPIKey` | Revoke API key | done — guard `Session`; soft by the `revoked_at` stamp the schema reserved, idempotent (a second revocation is the same success and records nothing), and a key another account owns answers `not_found` | `modules/apikey.TestRevokeIsSoftAndIdempotent` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.apikey.v1.ApiKeyService/ListAllAPIKeys` | List all API keys | done — guard `Admin`; tango-only, the administrative view over every key the deployment holds (upstream has none); the answer names each key's owner | `modules/apikey.TestListOwnScopesToTheOwnerAndListAllSeesEverything`, `internal/transport.TestTheAPIKeyGuardIsDeclared` |

Shared rules: the authwall is one read — the hash of the presented header is looked up against
`revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now AND NOT users.disabled`, so an unknown, expired, revoked,
or disabled-owner key answers the same refusal and the disablement of an account takes effect on
its keys' next request, not at a token mint; the `last_used_at` the lookup touches is a metric,
not a decision, and its write is best-effort. The refusal never says which half failed. Audit
events: `api_key_created`, `api_key_renewed`, `api_key_revoked`, and
`api_key_expiry_email_sent` — recorded in the transaction that caused them, naming the owner in
`user_id` and the key in `resource_type`/`resource_id`. Not ported: the static API key (a
configuration credential acting as a manufactured administrator — tango issues keys through the
surface instead) and the upstream's direct-send reminder mail (tango's reminder travels the
durable queue).

## APIs

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApiService/ListApis` | List APIs | done | `modules/admin/apiaccess.TestRPCAPILifecycle` |

| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApiService/ListAssignableApisForClient` | List APIs a client can still be granted | done | `modules/admin/apiaccess.TestRPCGrantLifecycle` |

## Application Configuration

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApplicationConfigurationService/Get` | Public bootstrap configuration | done — anonymous view the SPA reads before sign-in | `modules/admin/appconfig.TestRPCConfigBootstrapIsAnonymous` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApplicationConfigurationService/GetAll` | List all application configurations | done — admin | `modules/admin/appconfig.TestRPCConfigLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApplicationConfigurationService/Update` | Update application configurations | done — partial update | `modules/admin/appconfig.TestRPCConfigLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.admin.v1.ApplicationConfigurationService/TestEmail` | Send test email | done — admin; defaults to the signed-in administrator | `modules/admin/appconfig.TestRPCConfigLifecycle` |
| GET | `/api/application-configuration` | List public application configurations | REST — unauthenticated bootstrap read | `modules/admin/appconfig.TestConfigCRUD` |
| POST | `/api/application-configuration/sync-ldap` | Synchronize LDAP | excluded | — |

## Application Images

| Method | Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| DELETE, GET, PUT | `/api/application-images/*` | Bundled application images | excluded — served from `public/images` through `/static/*` | `internal/transport.TestStaticAssetsHandler` |
| GET | `/api/storage/sqlite-warning` | SQLite storage warning | excluded — Postgres is the only supported database | — |

## Audit Logs

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auditlog.v1.AuditLogService/List` | List audit logs | done — the caller's own records; guard `Authenticated`, so a delegated (impersonated) caller is refused | `modules/auditlog` (service tests), `internal/transport.TestTheAuditListAnswersTheCallersOwnRecordsOnly` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auditlog.v1.AuditLogService/ListAll` | List all audit logs | done — guard `Admin`; filters `event`, `user_id`, `search` (username/email) | `modules/auditlog` (service tests), `internal/transport.TestTheAdministrativeAuditProceduresAnswerAnAdministrator` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auditlog.v1.AuditLogService/ListForUser` | (tango-only) list one account's records | done — guard `Admin`; the administrative view of a single account | `modules/auditlog` (service tests) |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.auditlog.v1.AuditLogService/FilterOptions` | List filter facets | done — guard `Admin`; facets are `events` (distinct events in the table) and `users` (accounts that appear in it). Upstream's `client-names` facet is **not** ported: tango has no OIDC client, so `payload->>'client_name'` is never written | `modules/auditlog` (service tests), `internal/transport.TestTheAdministrativeAuditProceduresAnswerAnAdministrator` |

The writer is `internal/audit` (shared infrastructure, injected into the features); the reader is `modules/auditlog`. Events written today: `sign_in`, `account_created` (both sign-up and the administrator's CreateUser), `account_updated`, `account_deleted`, `email_verification_sent`, `email_verified`, `profile_picture_updated`, `profile_picture_reset`. Sign-out has no event: `modules/identity/session` is a scaffold, so nothing can sign out. Retention: `audit.retention_days` (default 90) applied by the `audit_cleanup` recurring job.

## Custom Claims

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |

## Device Login

The device side is an integration flow and stays HTTP; the approval UI is first-party and moved to
ConnectRPC.

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/api/device-login/requests` | Create device login request | REST — pairing cookie rides the response | `modules/identity/devicelogin.TestCreateApproveExchange` |
| POST | `/api/device-login/requests/{id}/exchange` | Exchange device login request | REST — long-poll; the device holds the request id | `modules/identity/devicelogin.TestCreateApproveExchange` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.DeviceApprovalService/GetPendingRequest` | Inspect device login request | done — carries the user code | `modules/identity/devicelogin.TestRPCApprovalFlow`, `modules/identity/devicelogin.TestRPCApprovalValidation` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.DeviceApprovalService/DecideRequest` | Decide device login request | done — carries the user code + approve flag | `modules/identity/devicelogin.TestRPCApprovalFlow` |

## Health

| Method | Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| GET | `/healthz` | Responds to healthchecks | REST — liveness, dependencies untouched | `internal/transport.TestAPIHealthzReportsTheChecker` |
| GET | `/api/healthz` | Readiness document | REST — per-dependency results | `internal/transport.TestAPIHealthzReportsTheChecker` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.system.v1.HealthService/Check` | Readiness over ConnectRPC | done — the same checker and the same result as `/api/healthz`; fails with `unavailable` naming the checks that are down | `internal/transport.TestRPCCheckAnswersTheReadinessDocument`, `internal/transport.TestRPCUnhealthyAnswersUnavailable` |

## OIDC

Client administration and consents are first-party and moved to ConnectRPC. The public logo read,
the interaction pages, and every protocol endpoint stay HTTP.

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |

The protocol endpoints are verified by the same suite: `/authorize` →
`modules/federation/oidc.TestEndToEndAuthorizeTokenUserinfo` and friends. It
accepts an RFC 9126 `request_uri` in place of inline parameters (one-time; a replayed push is
rejected); `/api/oidc/end-session` → `modules/federation/oidc.TestEndSessionRevokesFamilyAndRedirects`:
the `id_token_hint` must verify (issuer, audience, subject, jti), the `client_id` must match the
hint's audience, and the user must have granted the client — every failure redirects to the
instance logout page without explaining why. Ending the session deactivates the grant's whole
token family (the ID token carries the access token's `jti`), replays are idempotent, and an
unregistered `post_logout_redirect_uri` is never followed;
`/.well-known/*` and JWKS → `modules/federation/discovery` and `modules/federation/jwks`. The
discovery document advertises the device, PAR, and introspection endpoints plus upstream's
metadata fields (`response_modes_supported`, `prompt_values_supported`, `grant_types_supported`
with the device grant, `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported`,
`client_id_metadata_document_supported: false`, `require_pushed_authorization_requests: false`).
Device-flow codes are stored hashed; the poll answers `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`,
`expired_token`, and `access_denied` per RFC 8628 §3.5.

## SCIM

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.federation.v1.ScimProviderService/Upsert` | Create SCIM service provider | done | `modules/federation/scimsync.TestRPCProviderLifecycle` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.federation.v1.ScimProviderService/Update` | Update SCIM service provider | done | `modules/federation/scimsync.TestRPCProviderLifecycle` |

## User Groups

The groups accounts belong to. A group carries no permission of its own; the members it gathers
are addressed together, and a later feature may hang claims on a group or gate a client on it.
Every procedure is administrative — upstream guards the surface with its admin middleware — and
the member count every answer carries is what the query computes, never a column.

| Method | Procedure | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/ListUserGroups` | List user groups | done — page/limit/search over the name and the display name; sorted by `name`, `display_name`, `user_count`, or `created_at`, ascending by default, the name columns case-insensitively; the LEFT join makes an empty group a row with a zero count, not an absence | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestListGroupsSearchesPaginatesAndSorts`, `internal/transport.TestTheUserGroupLoopEndsInAMemberList` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/GetUserGroup` | Get user group by ID | done — the detail carries the members as the account wire view, ordered by username | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestCreateGroupStoresTheRowAndRefusesADuplicateName`, `internal/transport.TestTheUserGroupLoopEndsInAMemberList` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/CreateUserGroup` | Create user group | done — the duplicate name is the unique index's answer read from the write's failure, mapped to `already_exists`; the created row is read back inside the transaction | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestCreateGroupStoresTheRowAndRefusesADuplicateName` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/UpdateUserGroup` | Update user group | done — full replace of the two fields; a name another group holds is refused and the other group stays intact; an unknown identifier is `not_found` | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestUpdateGroupReplacesTheFieldsAndRefusesADuplicate` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/DeleteUserGroup` | Delete user group | done — the membership rows die with the group by the foreign keys' cascade, the accounts are untouched; the record of the deletion names the member count it took away, the one fact a later reader cannot reconstruct | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestDeleteGroupRemovesTheMemberships` |
| POST | `/rpc/tango.identity.v1.UserGroupService/SetUserGroupMembers` | Update users in a group | done — the replace, not a delta: an empty list empties the group; every identifier must name an account, and a member that does not exist refuses the replacement whole, so the group keeps the set it held | `modules/identity/usergroup.TestSetMembersReplacesTheWholeSet` |

Audit events: `group_created`, `group_updated`, `group_deleted`, and `group_members_updated` —
the membership change is its own event, because the log's one filter cannot see inside a payload.
Upstream records nothing for groups; tango records every administrative write, the way it does
for accounts. Not ported: the allowed-OIDC-clients update (the federation surface decides it),
the LDAP guards (tango has no LDAP), and the custom claims a group carries (the customclaim
feature owns them when it lands).

## Users

| Method | Procedure / Endpoint | Summary / Yaak Title | Status | Evidence |
