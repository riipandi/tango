        --    We accept alarms mapping to an active actor if they either:
        --      - Map to an actor that's active on a host in the allowlist
        --      - Map to an actor that's active on an unhealthy host
        --    The CTE loads host IDs both from the pre-filtered allowlist (the temp_active_hosts table), and from the
        --    active_actors table, looking at all the actors of the types we care about (those that can be executed on
        --    the hosts in the allowlist).
        -- 2. actor_type_capacity:
        --    This CTE computes the sum of the available capacity for each actor type, across all hosts in the allowlist.
        -- 3. ranked_alarms:
        --    This CTE looks up the list of alarms and assigns a "rank".
        --    Alarms are filtered by:
        --      - Limiting to the actor types that can be executed on the hosts in the request and for which we have any
        --        capacity (this is done with the INNER JOIN on actor_type_capacity)
        --      - Ensuring their due time is within the horizon we are considering
        --      - Selecting alarms that aren't leased, or whose lease has expired
        --      - Selecting alarms that are not tied to an active actor, or whose actor is in the allowed_actor_hosts list
        --    Among all the filtered alarms, it assigns a "rank" which is the ROW_NUMBER(). This is sorted by the due time
        --    and partitioned by actor type. It looks at all filtered alarms (more than the batch size, but still within
        --    the time horizon and with the other filters listed above), and assigns a rank for each actor type: for example,
        --    if we have capacity for alarms of types A and B, the earliest alarm of type A will have rank 1, and so will
        --    the earliest of type B.
        --    There's one exception, which is that when the alarm is for an actor that's already active on a host in the
        --    allowlist, we assign it a rank of 0, as it doesn't use more capacity.
        --    This "ranking" selects a lot or rows, and it's the reason why this is the "slow" path.
        -- 4. Finally, select from the ranked list, returning alarms for which there's sufficient capacity, in order of
        --    of execution time. We do this by excluding the rows from ranked_alarms in which the row number is greater than the
        --    capacity left (e.g. if we have capacity for only 4 actors of type A, ranked rows for type A with row number
        --    greater than 4 are excluded).
