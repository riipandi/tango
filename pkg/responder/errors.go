// WriteError maps an error to the standard response envelope.
//
// A validation error is the caller's to fix, so it travels: 422 with the field
// errors attached. Anything else is opaque — the client learns that the
// request failed and nothing about why — and the cause is written to the log
// instead.
//
// The log line is not a courtesy. This is the one place an unexpected failure
// becomes a response, so a run that answers "internal error" without naming
// the cause leaves an operator with a status code and no thread to pull. The
// request id ties the line to the response the client was given.
