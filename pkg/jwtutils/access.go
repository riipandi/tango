// AccessClaims are the private claims an access token carries. The subject is

// consumer decodes it: the feature that signs and every seam that verifies.

	// issued to another account. The subject still names the account the

	// audit record and a refusal both need. They are omitted from a token
	// that belongs to the account it names, which is every token that is not
	// a delegation, so a claim that is present is the whole signal that the
	// caller is acting for someone else.
	//
	// The pair is this application's spelling of the delegation an OAuth
	// token exchange (RFC 8693) calls `act`: the actor is recorded beside the
	// subject rather than replacing it, so no seam has to reconstruct who is
	// really acting.

	// the Caller that carries them, and the rule that refuses them on a
	// self-service request are in place and tested, but the two procedures
	// that would populate them do not exist: no `ImpersonateUser` mints a
	// token with this pair set and no `StopImpersonating` returns the caller
	// to their own account. The session column the durable record belongs in
	// already exists (`public.sessions.impersonated_by`, migration 00002) and
	// is unused by Go code, so nothing records a delegation today and
	// `IsImpersonating` is always false outside tests. Port the surface from
	// Better Auth's admin plugin: `POST /admin/impersonate-user` (bounded TTL,
	// admin may not impersonate another admin without an explicit permission,
	// revocable) and `POST /admin/stop-impersonating` (which must be callable
	// while impersonating, so it is `Authenticated` in the guard table rather
	// than `Self`).
