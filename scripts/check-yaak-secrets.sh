# Reject credential literals in the tracked Yaak export.
#
# The workspace is exported to api/specs/ and committed, so a value typed into a
# request body lands in git. Commit a23ddcd removed the credentials once; commit
# 4a095a6 reformatted 131 request bodies and wrote two back. This check is the
# guard against a third time.
#
# A credential field is accepted when its value is empty, a REPLACE_* placeholder,
# or a ${[ ... ]} template reference. Anything else is a literal.

# Usage: check-yaak-secrets.sh <file> [file...]
