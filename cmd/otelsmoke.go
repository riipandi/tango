enables, so tracing and metrics can be proved end to end against a real backend
before anything depends on them.

It prints where each signal is exported and the query that reads it back:

  task metrics:up
  OTEL_TRACING_ENABLE=true OTEL_METRICS_ENABLE=true \
  task metrics:smoke:otel

A signal that is switched off is reported as off and nothing is recorded for it.
Nothing is written to the configuration; this command only reads it.`,

//
// It builds the observer through the same accessor a command uses, so the run
// proves the wiring a real command gets, not a pipeline assembled for the test.
