	Description: `Checks the application dependencies and reports the aggregated
availability status. The same result is published by the REST handler,
so the CLI and the API always agree.

It checks that Postgres answers and that the application data directory
(storage by default, or storage.local_path from the configuration) exists,
is writable, and is not world-writable. The optional Valkey backend is
checked only while kvstore.enable is on.

Output is text by default; pass --json for a machine-readable result or
--short for the aggregated status alone.

Exit codes: 0 when healthy, 3 when a required component is down, 1 on
a usage error such as a missing DATABASE_URL. A component that cannot
be reached is reported as unhealthy, not as a command failure.

The check needs DATABASE_URL; pass --env-file or export it.`,
