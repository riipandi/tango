	Description: `Writes one line at each configured log level through the transports named by
log.transport, so the logging path can be proved end to end against a real
backend before anything depends on it.

It prints where each transport writes and the query that reads the line back,
so a run against a local VictoriaLogs can be checked without opening Perses:

  task metrics:up
  LOG_TRANSPORT=console,file,otlp \
  LOG_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9428/insert/opentelemetry/v1/logs \
  task metrics:smoke

Nothing is written to the configuration; this command only reads it.`,

// runLoggerSmoke builds the configured logger, emits the probe lines, and flushes
// them.
//
// It builds the logger itself rather than using loggerFrom, because the point is
// to report a transport that cannot be built: loggerFrom would hand back the same
// error, but the command that exists to diagnose logging should not fail before
// it can say which transport broke.

	// other run, so the query names this field rather than looking for an empty
	// store. The level is carried by the entry itself, so the probe field only
	// says which line this is — naming it "level" would collide with the
	// structured transport's own level key.
